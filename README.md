My Own Created Search Engine with CSS , HTML and Javascript . It has a few sites only...
You can search few sites in the search bar (second one) where you have to click the search button.. if there are any results then it will be displayed , if no result nothing will be displayed . 
and the First one is the URL opener where you have to enter a url without http/https . 
GLAD YOU LIKE IT!
